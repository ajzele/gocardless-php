## GoCardless PHP Client Library

The GoCardless PHP client provides a simple PHP interface to the GoCardless
API.

If you want to use the library as an individual merchant, refer to the
[merchant guide](https://gocardless.com/docs/php/merchant_client_guide). If
you want to support multiple merchant accounts, see the
[partner guide](https://gocardless.com/docs/php/partner_client_guide).
